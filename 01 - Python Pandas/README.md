# 01 - Pandas and Data Wrangling

In this exercise you will test your skills on using the `Pandas` library for a few basic Data Wrangling tasks.
The homework consists of `2` tasks which are described in the `Exercise 1.ipynb` notebook.
In order to solve these tasks, use the data folder provided in the repository in *read-only mode*.

For each exercise, please provide *both* a written explanation of the steps you followed, and the corresponding code. 
Keep in mind that writing the explanation can help you in two ways: 1) clarifying the steps in your
mind before writing the actual code, 2) earning you points if the description is correct, regardless of the potential issues in your code.

### Deliverables
`Exercise 1.ipynb` notebook with disclosed output for each cell. 

#### Deadline: October 10, 23:59
